I am a Washington, D.C. based frontend developer. Currently, I work on the product team at [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com). Previously, I was a full stack developer at a small public relations firm with a primary focus on custom WordPress websites.

Outside of work, I enjoy creating/appreciating music, any physical activity, and exploring the great outdoors.
