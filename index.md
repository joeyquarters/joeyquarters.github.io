I'm a software engineer based in Los Angeles, CA currently working to expand access to better skincare at [Curology](https://curology.com).

Previously, I've helped people celebrate their special moments at [The Black Tux](https://theblacktux.com) and supported the talented journalists at _[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com)_.
