I'm a **self-taught** software engineer based in Los Angeles, CA. I work at [The Black Tux](https://theblacktux.com) as a Senior Software Engineer. My main focus is on **performance** and **accessibility**.

Previously, I worked to deliver **fast** and **user-friendly** journalism to the masses at _[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com)_ in Washington, DC. I have also crafted **engaging** and **focused** websites for a variety of non-profits and think tanks as a full-stack developer. I love learning about new technology and **constantly** strive to improve my skillset.
