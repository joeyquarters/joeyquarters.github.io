I'm a **self-taught** web developer based in Washington, D.C. I work at *[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com)* as a front end developer. My main focus is on **performance** and **accessibility**.

Previously, I crafted **engaging** and **focused** websites for a variety of non-profits and think tanks as a full-stack developer. I love learning about new technology and **constantly** strive to improve my skillset.

Interested in working together? Shoot an email to **[joeyquarters@gmail.com](mailto:joeyquarters@gmail.com)**.
